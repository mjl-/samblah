Bugs:
- Find out why smbc_stat seemingly randomly returns errors when connecting to
  certain computers.
- Chdir's to some directories succeed when the directories do not exist.  Which
  ones?
- Fix transfers of files >2GB.
- Rework uri functions in smbwrap.c.
- Fix XXX's.
- What about connecting to one server multiple times with different
  usernames/passwords.  Will the callback call back?  Probably not.
- Find solution to readline quoting problems.
- See about character encodings in libsmbclient.
- Use utf-8 or locale indepedent functions for determining length?
  Would be useful for progress bar.
- Instead of using smb{,c}_readdir, getdents (or what its name is) could be
  used, perhaps that is more efficient (need to check if libsmbclient requests
  directory entries efficiently, i.e. read more than requested).  Some more
  caching could be done.
- Improve progress bar.
- Rework tokenmatc2 in smbglob.c, smbwrap.c and transfer.c.
- Check whether samblah works with with samba-3.
- Polish DESIGN.
- Write about str.c and list.c in DESIGN.
